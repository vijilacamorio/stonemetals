                               <p style="text-align:justify;">Stone ribbing refers to the architectural technique of adding raised, linear elements to stone surfaces, creating a series of ribs or ridges. This design feature is used to enhance the visual and textural appeal of stone elements in both interior and exterior applications. Stone ribbing can be seen in various architectural components, including walls, columns, arches, and facades.</p>    
                              <h4>Applications:</h4>
                              <li><strong>Facades and Cladding:</strong>&nbsp;Stone ribbing is commonly used on building facades to create a striking visual effect, adding depth and character to the exterior. It can help break up large, flat surfaces and provide a play of light and shadow.</li>
                              <li><strong>Columns and Pillars:</strong>&nbsp;In classical architecture, ribbing is often found on columns and pillars, giving them a more detailed and refined appearance. This technique can be used to emphasize the verticality and strength of the structure.</li>
                              <li><strong>Interior Wall Features:</strong>&nbsp;Stone ribbing can also be applied to interior walls as a decorative element, providing texture and enhancing the ambiance of a space. It is especially effective in creating focal points in lobbies, hallways, or feature walls.</li>
                               <br>
                               <h4>Benefits</h4>
                               <li><strong>Aesthetic Enhancement:</strong>&nbsp;Stone ribbing adds visual interest and texture, making surfaces more dynamic and engaging. The ribbed pattern can range from subtle to bold, depending on the design intent.</li>
                               <li><strong>Durability:</strong>&nbsp;Like other stonework, ribbed stone is durable and long-lasting, offering both beauty and resilience.</li>
                               <li><strong>Versatility:</strong>&nbsp;This technique can be applied to various types of stone, including marble, granite, limestone, and sandstone, allowing for a wide range of colors and finishes.</li>
                               <br>
                               <p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Design Considerations:</strong>&nbsp;Stone ribbing can be customized in terms of rib width, depth, and spacing, offering endless possibilities for creative expression. It can be used to complement both traditional and modern architectural styles, depending on the design and execution.</p>    
                               <p style="text-align:justify;"> Overall, stone ribbing is a versatile and sophisticated architectural feature that adds texture, elegance, and a sense of craftsmanship to any stone surface.</p>    
                               <br>
                               <p style="text-align:justify;">Marble flutes are elegant architectural elements carved from high-quality marble, commonly used in both interior and exterior design to add a touch of classical sophistication. These cylindrical or semi-cylindrical features are characterized by their vertical grooves, known as flutes, which create a play of light and shadow, enhancing the visual appeal of the marble.</p>    
                               <h4>Applications:</h4>
                              <li><strong>Columns:</strong>&nbsp;Marble flutes are often used in columns, providing a classic and timeless look that can be found in grand entranceways, facades, and interior spaces.</li>
                              <li><strong>Pillars:</strong>&nbsp;They can also be applied to decorative pillars, adding structural elegance and refinement to spaces like lobbies, hallways, and courtyards.</li>
                              <li><strong>Wall Panels:</strong>&nbsp;: In contemporary settings, marble flutes are increasingly used as wall cladding, bringing texture and depth to flat surfaces and creating a luxurious atmosphere.</li>
                               <br>
                               <h4>Benefits</h4>
                               <li><strong>Aesthetic Enhancement:</strong>&nbsp;The fluted design enhances the natural beauty of marble, highlighting its veins and color variations while adding a sense of movement and dimension.</li>
                               <li><strong>Durability:</strong>&nbsp;: Marble is a strong, durable stone that can withstand wear and tear, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor applications.</li>
                               <li><strong>Versatility:</strong>&nbsp;Marble flutes offer a timeless appeal that can complement various architectural styles, from classical to modern, making them a versatile choice in design.</li>
                               <br>
                               <p style="text-align:justify;">Marble flutes are not only a decorative feature but also a testament to fine craftsmanship, offering a blend of natural beauty and artistic detail.
